# How To Install NPM

Before installing, check if npm is already installed and its current version by running:
```bash
npm -v
```

A valid result would return a similar output:
```bash
10.2.3
```

If a version number does not appear, install npm based on your operating system below:

### OS X or Windows
Use one of the installers from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure to install the version labeled **LTS**, as other versions are not fully tested.

### Linux/Other Operating System
- [NodeSource installer](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) (recommended)
- [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Or see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for a list of installers for less common operating systems.

# Next.js

Next.js build by Vercel is a React framework that builds fullstack applications. It provides capabilities for SSR (server side rendering) and SSG (static site generation). Most ACM projects fall under SSG since there is no dynamic content to show.

## What's the difference?

Most React concepts are still applicable (ie. components, props), however there are some subtle changes primarily to backend development and project organization that affect the developer experience. There are a ton of under the hood changes which optimize Next.js to be performant and provide more features than React alone could provide.

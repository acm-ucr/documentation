# Utility classes
> ðŸ’¡ The [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) have excellent explanations and diagrams on each utility class. 



Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that provides low-level, reusable classes, each serving a specific design purpose. Utility classes follow the format `{property}-{modifier}`. You apply them inside the `className` attribute within a JSX container. By combining these utility classes directly in HTML, you can build complex designs without writing custom CSS.

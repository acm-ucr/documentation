# Technical

> ‚ùó How to Prepare

## Resources
- Code Editor (can use any - VSCode, Replit etc)
- Choose your Language (C++, C, Python, Java etc)
- Paper/pencil if you want to write out your algorithm
## What to Expect
You will be given a prompt, a function header and a couple test cases to verify your code. You will be asked to solve the problem using any method you'd like as long as the code compiles without error and the test cases pass. 

The prompt will involve concepts from the *CS010(A-C)* series (likely Leetcode Easy to Medium). 

You should know how to compile code on your editor, have necessary libraries for your language, how to run test cases and how to debug. 

**Tips:** Start by reiterating the prompt as you understand it. Then, explain your thought process and your approach to the problem. Do not hesitate to ask for clarifications or guidance as you code. Ask to look up syntax if you need to.

*Note: for online interviews, you need to share full screen for this part*

## How to Practice
- Review your notes from your CS010 classes.
- Brush up on Data Structures
- Practice on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) etc

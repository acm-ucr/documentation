Below we have laid out a general guide for you to ace your ACM project interview. 

## Preparation
First and foremost, be on the lookout for the Application Update email. This email has detailed instructions on your next steps. Schedule an interview on Calendly (in-person/online) for a convenient time.

- Know and understand the projects you are interested in and their corresponding tech stacks (read project description on the application form) 
- Update your Resume (Need Help? [Resume Examples](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv))
- Jot down your personal/class projects to highlight during the interview
- List your interpersonal skills and how you've incorporated them in your past experiences
- If you don't have projects, do not worry. Have a detailed summary of your non-technical experiences.
- Be aware of your commitments for the quarter including classes, extracurricular activities and/or work

## Interview
Show up on time. Start with a brief introduction of yourself. This can be simply your name, year and major. 

#### Common Questions
- Why are you interested in ACM projects?
- Discuss your past experiences and how they will help you be successful
- Do you have any specific technical expertise that makes you a good fit for this particular project?
- What are your strong interpersonal skills?
- What do you hope to get out of this project?

**When discussing past projects:** describe project goal, your contribution, overall learning and tie it to the ACM project you want to work on. 

In general, always ask to clarify if you do not understand a question or need a quick second to gather your thoughts. If you have any questions or concerns, you can voice them at the end of the interview.

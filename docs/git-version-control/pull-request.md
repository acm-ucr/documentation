# Pull Requests

When a branch has been pushed and is ready for a pull request, you can create a pull request by clicking on `Pull Requests` tab and clicking on the `new pull request`. Here you will need to configure the involved branches, which will usually include a feature branch and the `dev` branch.

In addition, you will need to add a title, assignee (yourself), attach an issue under development, and attach screenshots of visual changes. An example of a properly formatted pull request can be accessed [here](https://github.com/acm-ucr/hackathon-website/pull/312).

# Pull Requests

When a branch has been pushed and is ready for a pull request, you can create a pull request by clicking on `Pull Requests` tab and clicking on the `new pull request`. Here you will need to configure the involved branches, which will usually include a feature branch and the `dev` branch.

Before submitting a pull request, your pull request must have the following items:

1. Title
2. Assignee (yourself)
3. Attached issue under `Development`
4. Screenshots of visual changes
5. Appropriate labels (ie. ready for review, frontend, landing)

If you are unable to provide any of the above items, please contact a team lead and they will be able to aid your further. Once your pull request is finalized, you can submit the pull request to the pull-request channel within the Discord server.

An example of a properly formatted pull request can be accessed [here](https://github.com/acm-ucr/hackathon-website/pull/312).
